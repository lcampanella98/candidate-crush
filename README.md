# candidate-crush

This game is built in libGDX.

Game Description:

The game consists of a board filled with the candidates of the 2016 presidential election. The current version of the game uses Clinton, Sanders, Trump, and Cruz.

Flip two candidates to make three or more in a row and/or column. They will then dissapear and turn into points, and the board will stack new candidates.

About the new-and-improved-branch:

The version of the project in this branch takes advantage of libGDX's scene2d, which will make the code simpler, cleaner, and more manageable.
