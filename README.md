# candidate-crush
crush candidates with vigor!

This game uses libGDX.
Candidate Crush is still under development, but there is a working version in the master branch.

Game Description:

The game consists of a board filled with the candidates of the 2016 presidential election. The current version of the game uses Clinton, Sanders, Trump, and Cruz.

Flip two candidates to make three or more in a row and/or column. They will then dissapear and turn into points, and the board will stack new candidates.
